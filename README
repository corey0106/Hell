           hands free usenet file retrieval and post processing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLING:
--------------------------------------------------
It is recommended that you install hellanzb via one of the packaging systems
(FreeBSD ports, Mac OS X darwinports, Linux RPM). The latest port files are
available from:

http://www.hellanzb.com/distfiles

Otherwise, to install hellanzb manually:

Prerequisites:

Unix O/S                E.g.: http://www.freebsd.org, http://www.apple.com/macosx
Python >= 2.3           http://www.python.org
Twisted >= 1.3          http://www.twistedmartrix.com
par2cmdline =~ 0.4      http://parchive.sourceforge.net
rar or unrar =~ 3.41    http://www.rarlab.com

hellanzb can either be ran from it's own directory, or to install it system wide,
simply run (as root):

    "python setup.py install"

CONFIGURING
--------------------------------------------------
o Copy the <prefix>/etc/hellanzb.conf.sample file to hellanzb.conf in the
  same directory
  (This is done for you by the ports)

  The prefix is typically:
    /usr/local (FreeBSD) or
    /opt/local (Darwin)
    or the hellanzb directory if ran locally within it
    
o Open the config file and edit the directories (PREFIX, DEST_DIR, etc) to
  your liking. The important directories are the QUEUE directory (where
  you'll put nzb files to add to the queue) and the DEST dir (where the
  finished files are placed)

o Configure your usenet connection with a defineServer line

o Edit the defineMusicType lines to match the music decompressors
  installed on your system

o [Optional] Edit the growler configuration to enable Mac OS X Growl
  notifications.

o Run hellanzb.py. Copy files to the QUEUE directory, watch hellanzb (or go do
  something else) download and process your nzb archives, leaving the finished
  files in the DEST dir.

MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------------------------------------

o Make sure your terminal is at least 80 columns wide otherwise you'll see
  download status lines scroll off the screen
