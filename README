hellanzb 
--------------------------------------------------

How to get started with hellanzb:

o Copy the <prefix>/etc/hellanzb.conf.sample file to hellanzb.conf
  (This is done for you by the ports)

  The prefix is typically:
    /usr/local (FreeBSD) or
    /opt/local (Darwin)
    
o Open the config file and edit the directories (PREFIX, DEST_DIR, etc) to
  your liking. The most important directories are the QUEUE directory (where
  you'll put nzb files to add to the queue) and the DEST dir (where the
  finished files are placed)

o Create at least one defineServer line. Multiple servers are supported

o Edit the defineMusicType lines to match the music decompressors
  installed on your system

o [Optional] Edit the growler configuration if you want Mac OS X Growler
  notifications. You must run the hellagrowler.py script on the Mac OS X
  machine to accept the notifications

o Run hellanzb.py. Copy files to the QUEUE directory, and after downloading
  and processing, you'll see the finished files in the DEST dir.
