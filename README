           hands free usenet file retrieval and post processing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLING:
--------------------------------------------------
It is recommended that you install hellanzb via one of the packaging systems
(FreeBSD ports, Mac OS X darwinports). The latest port files and the python
source tarball are available from:

http://www.hellanzb.com/distfiles

To alternatively install hellanzb manually (from the source tarball):

Prerequisites:

Unix O/S                E.g.: http://www.freebsd.org, http://www.apple.com/macosx
Python >= 2.3           http://www.python.org
Twisted >= 1.3          http://www.twistedmartrix.com
par2cmdline =~ 0.4      http://parchive.sourceforge.net
rar or unrar =~ 3.41    http://www.rarlab.com

hellanzb can either be ran from it's own directory, or to install it system wide,
simply run (as root) in the hellanzb directory:

    "python setup.py install"

CONFIGURING
--------------------------------------------------
o Copy <prefix>/etc/hellanzb.conf.sample to hellanzb.conf in the same
  directory (This is automatically done for you by the ports)

  The prefix is typically:
    /usr/local (FreeBSD) or
    /opt/local (Darwin)
    or the hellanzb directory if ran locally within it
    
o Open hellanzb.conf and edit the directories (PREFIX, DEST_DIR, etc) to
  your liking. The important directories are the QUEUE directory (where
  you'll put nzb files to add to the queue) and the DEST dir (where the
  finished files are placed)

o Configure your usenet connection with a defineServer line

o Edit the defineMusicType lines to match the music decompressors
  installed on your system

o [Optional] Edit the growler configuration to enable Mac OS X Growl
  notifications

USING
--------------------------------------------------
Run hellanzb.py

Move .nzb files into the QUEUE directory

Watch hellanzb (or go do something else) download and process your nzb
archives, leaving the finished files in the DEST dir

MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------------------------------------

o Make sure your terminal is at least 80 columns wide otherwise you may see
  download status lines scroll off the screen

o You can make hellanzb simply post process a downloaded archive and exit:

  "hellanzb.py -p ArchiveDirectoryName"

  In the case the archive contains password protected rars:

  "hellanzb.py -p ArchiveDirectoryName -P rarPassword"

o hellanzb logs it's output to /var/tmp/hellanzb.log by default (this can be
  turned off in the configuration file -- we encourage it's use in the rare
  case of something unexpected happening)

o In the rare case that something unexpected happens, try reproducing it with
  Hellanzb.DEBUG_MODE (or hellanzb.py -d) enabled. This will produce a
  highly verbose DEBUG file that will contain any unexpected errors that were
  not picked up by the normal log file
