hellanzb is a Python script designed to be run under a *nix environment to retrieve nzb
files and fully process them. The goal being to make getting files from Usenet as
hands-free as possible. Once fully installed, all thats required is moving an nzb file to
the queue directory. The rest; fetching, par-checking, un-raring, etc. is taken care of by
hellanzb.
